## Requirements

* Node.js version 12.16.2+
* Npm version 6.14.4+

## Getting Started

The dapp is a client side only project and is built using the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev)  scripts.

### Instalation and running

### Step 1. Install modules

From a terminal, navigate to the project folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 2. Update environment

Go to `App.tsx` and edit the `environment` variable according to the environment you want the app to run on.
Valid values are `testnet`, `devnet` or `mainnet`

If you need to edit the network configuration, you can pass in a `customNetworkConfig` object.

### Step 3. Running in development mode

In the project folder run:

```bash
npm run start
```

This will start the React app in development mode, using the configs found in the `config.tsx` file.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Step 4. Build for testing and production use

A build of the app is necessary to deploy for testing purposes or for production use.
To build the project run:

```bash
npm run build
```
